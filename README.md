# Monster-Masher
Part of the RPG Card Game MVPs, MVP #4. Mini-game that involves repeatedly attacking the monster with a changing movelist. 

## Demonstration
<p> Your goal is to take down the monster infront of you. You have a list of moves, but they're all empty aside from Punch.</p>

<p> After using Punch a number of times, you get access to some uses of Axe Kick now. Using it will deal a good amount of damage more than Punch.</p>
